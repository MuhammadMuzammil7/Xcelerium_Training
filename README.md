# Xcelerium Training – Digital Design Tasks

This repository contains the work completed during **Xcelerium Training**, focusing on **digital design using SystemVerilog**.  
The repository is organized into multiple task folders, where each task demonstrates the implementation and verification of different digital hardware modules.

The designs include **combinational and sequential circuits**, along with **layered testbenches** to validate functionality through simulation.

## 📌 Task Overview

### 🔹 Task 1 – Combinational Logic Designs
This task focuses on **basic combinational digital circuits**.  
Each module is implemented using SystemVerilog and verified using a self-checking testbench.

Modules include:
- 32-bit Adder
- Barrel Shifter
- Priority Encoder

### 🔹 Task 2 – Arithmetic & Sequential Circuits
This task extends to **more complex arithmetic circuits** and **sequential designs**, including registered implementations.
Each design is verified using a system verilog based layered testbench.

Modules include:
- Multipliers (Adder Tree Multiplier & Array Multiplier)
- Counter
- Register
- Shift Register

## Notes
- Each task folder contains its own `README.md` explaining the internal structure and functionality.
- Testbench files (`*_tb.sv`) are included to verify correctness via simulation.
- The repository is structured for clarity, modularity, and ease of understanding.
